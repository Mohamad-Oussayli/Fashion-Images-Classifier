# Fashion-Images-Classifier

## Objective

This project involves building, optimizing, and evaluating a neural network model for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to enhance the modelâ€™s performance through hyperparameter tuning and to assess its effectiveness in classifying different types of fashion items.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset, consisting of:

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images with corresponding labels.
- **Cross-Validation Set**: 12,000 images with corresponding labels.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images with corresponding labels.

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing one of 10 fashion categories.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  - Splitting the dataset into training, cross-validation, and test sets.

- **Model Development**:
